**Old repo, use [ExtraModels](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI_ExtraModels) instead for DiT support.**

# ComfyUI_DiT

I needed a platform to test [DiT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT) on. None of this code is stable, expect breaking changes if for some reason you want to use this.

A lot of the code is based on the original Meta repository. I included the license for this under `LICENSE-DiT`.
